14. UPKEEP & MAINTENANCE

=============================================================================
OVERVIEW
=============================================================================

This section outlines the regular tasks and monitoring needed to keep your Mail Management System running smoothly.

Most of these tasks are simple checks that take 5-15 minutes. They help you:
- Avoid unexpected service interruptions
- Catch problems before they become critical
- Stay within free tier limits
- Keep customer data secure

=============================================================================
MONTHLY MAINTENANCE CHECKLIST
=============================================================================

TASK 1: Check Supabase Database Usage

Why: Free tier has 500MB limit. If exceeded, app may stop working.

How:
1. Log into Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings → Database
4. Check "Database Size"
5. Look at the usage bar

What to do:
- Under 400MB (80%): ✅ You're fine
- 400-480MB (80-96%): ⚠️ Start planning to upgrade to Pro ($25/month)
- Over 480MB (96%+): 🚨 Upgrade to Pro immediately to avoid downtime

Current usage as of handoff: 27MB (5.4%)
Estimated time until limit: 12-18 months at current growth rate

---

TASK 2: Review Unclaimed Mail (Follow-Ups)

Why: Mail sitting too long costs storage fees and clutters your system.

How:
1. Log into your app
2. Click "Follow-Ups" in left menu
3. Review mail that's been waiting 30+ days

What to do:
- Send reminder emails to customers
- Contact customers who haven't responded
- Consider returning mail after 60-90 days per your business policy

Frequency: Check weekly or bi-weekly during busy seasons

---

TASK 3: Verify Email Notifications Are Working

Why: Customers need to know when mail arrives.

How:
1. Log a test mail item for yourself
2. Check "Send notification" box
3. Verify you receive the email within 2-3 minutes
4. Check spam folder if you don't see it

What to do if emails aren't sending:
- Check Gmail hasn't hit 500 emails/day limit (resets at midnight Pacific Time)
- Verify OAuth connection in app Settings
- Check Render backend is running (not sleeping)
- Contact developer if issue persists

---

TASK 4: Export Database Backup

Why: Extra safety net beyond Supabase's automatic backups.

How:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor
2. For each important table:
   - contacts
   - mail_items
   - package_fees
   - outreach_messages
   - message_templates
3. Click three-dot menu → Export → CSV
4. Save to external drive or encrypted cloud storage

Frequency: Monthly, or before major changes

Storage location: [Document where you keep these - external drive, encrypted folder, etc.]

---

TASK 5: Review User Access

Why: Remove access for staff who left or no longer need it.

How:
1. Log into Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to Authentication → Users
3. Review list of active users
4. Check GitHub collaborators at: https://github.com/mwmailplus-boop/mail-management-system/settings/access

What to do:
- Remove users who left the company
- Disable accounts for staff on long-term leave
- Verify all active users still need access

Frequency: Monthly or when staff changes occur

=============================================================================
QUARTERLY MAINTENANCE CHECKLIST
=============================================================================

TASK 1: Review Service Costs

Why: Stay aware of what you're spending and plan for future upgrades.

Current costs (as of handoff):
- Vercel: $0/month (free tier)
- Render: $0/month (free tier, sleeps after 15 min inactivity)
- Supabase: $0/month (free tier)
- Google Cloud: $0/month (under free tier limits)
- Gmail: $0/month (500 emails/day limit)
- GitHub: $0/month (free tier)
**Total: $0/month**

How to check:
1. Vercel: Dashboard → Settings → Billing
2. Render: Dashboard → Billing
3. Supabase: Dashboard → Settings → Billing
4. Google Cloud: https://console.cloud.google.com → Billing

What to watch for:
- Unexpected charges (could indicate compromised API keys)
- Usage approaching free tier limits
- Emails from services about billing issues

When to consider upgrading:
- Render ($7/month): If backend sleeping is causing issues
- Supabase ($25/month): When approaching 400MB database size
- Gmail/Google Workspace ($6/user/month): If you need to send 500+ emails/day

---

TASK 2: Update Passwords

Why: Regular password rotation improves security.

How:
1. Update your own app password (Settings → Change Password)
2. Update GitHub password
3. Rotate any shared team passwords

Frequency: Every 3-6 months

Don't forget to:
- Update passwords in your password manager
- Notify your developer if you change hosting platform passwords

---

TASK 3: Review System Performance

Why: Catch issues before customers complain.

How:
1. Log into the app
2. Test each major feature:
   - Login
   - Scan/log new mail
   - Send notification
   - Mark as picked up
   - View reports
   - Search for customers/mail
3. Note any slowness, errors, or issues

What to do if you find problems:
- Document the issue (what happened, when, what you were doing)
- Try again in 10 minutes (Render backend may have been sleeping)
- Contact developer if issue persists: ariel.chen@pursuit.org

---

TASK 4: Export Quarterly Reports

Why: Good for accounting, business analysis, and tax purposes.

How:
1. Go to Dashboard
2. Set date filter to "Last 3 months"
3. Take screenshots or export data
4. Save to your business records folder

What to export:
- Total mail received
- Storage fees collected
- Outstanding fees
- Customer activity
- Mail pickup statistics

=============================================================================
WHAT TO MONITOR (ONGOING)
=============================================================================

Service Status Indicators

Your app depends on these external services. Occasionally, they have outages.

How to check status:
- Vercel: https://www.vercel-status.com
- Render: https://status.render.com
- Supabase: https://status.supabase.com
- GitHub: https://www.githubstatus.com

If a service is down:
- Check their status page
- Wait 15-30 minutes (most outages resolve quickly)
- Your app will automatically recover when service comes back
- No action needed from you unless outage lasts 1+ hour

---

Critical Limits to Watch

1. Gmail: 500 emails per day
   - Limit resets at midnight Pacific Time
   - If hit, emails will fail until reset
   - Upgrade to Google Workspace ($6/user/month) for 2,000/day

2. Supabase Database: 500MB storage
   - Check monthly (see Monthly Task 1)
   - Upgrade to Pro at 400MB

3. Render Backend: Sleeps after 15 minutes inactivity
   - First load after sleep takes 30-60 seconds
   - Not an error, just how free tier works
   - Upgrade to $7/month for 24/7 availability

4. Vercel Bandwidth: 100GB/month
   - Unlikely to hit unless you have thousands of daily users
   - Check in Vercel Dashboard → Usage

---

Signs Something Is Wrong

Contact developer (ariel.chen@pursuit.org) if you notice:

🚨 **Critical (contact immediately):**
- App won't load at all
- Can't log in (and you know password is correct)
- Customer data appears missing or corrupted
- Notifications stopped sending for 24+ hours
- Error messages appearing for all users

⚠️ **Important (contact within 24-48 hours):**
- Slow performance that persists after refresh
- One feature not working (others work fine)
- Error messages appearing intermittently
- Unusual activity in user logs

✅ **Normal (not urgent):**
- First page load takes 30-60 seconds (Render sleeping)
- Minor visual glitches
- Feature requests or improvements
- Questions about how to use something

=============================================================================
WHAT COULD BREAK THE SYSTEM
=============================================================================

Understanding what could go wrong helps you prevent issues.

Scenario 1: Database Runs Out of Space

Cause: Exceeding 500MB limit on free tier
Symptoms: Can't log new mail, errors when loading pages
Prevention: Check database size monthly (see Monthly Task 1)
Fix: Upgrade to Supabase Pro ($25/month) immediately

---

Scenario 2: Gmail Hits Daily Email Limit

Cause: Sending 500+ emails in one day
Symptoms: "Failed to send notification" errors
Prevention: Monitor email volume, upgrade if regularly approaching limit
Fix: Wait until midnight Pacific Time for reset, or upgrade to Google Workspace

---

Scenario 3: API Keys Get Compromised

Cause: Keys accidentally shared publicly (e.g., posted to GitHub)
Symptoms: Unexpected charges, unauthorized access
Prevention: Never commit keys to GitHub, keep environment variables private
Fix: Immediately revoke all keys, generate new ones, update in Vercel/Render

---

Scenario 4: Backend Service Sleeping (Render)

Cause: No activity for 15 minutes (free tier behavior)
Symptoms: First load very slow (30-60 seconds), then fast
Prevention: Upgrade to Render paid plan ($7/month)
Fix: Not an error, just wait for first load to "wake up" the service

---

Scenario 5: Password or 2FA Access Lost

Cause: Forgot password, lost 2FA backup codes, phone stolen
Symptoms: Can't log into critical services
Prevention: Save 2FA backup codes, use password manager
Fix: Contact service support (GitHub, Vercel, etc.) - recovery takes days

---

Scenario 6: Hosting Service Outage

Cause: Vercel, Render, or Supabase has temporary downtime
Symptoms: App won't load, shows errors
Prevention: None (external issue)
Fix: Wait for service to recover (usually 15-30 minutes)

=============================================================================
KNOWN LIMITATIONS
=============================================================================

Your system has some built-in limitations. These are normal and expected.

Limitation 1: Render Backend Sleeps After 15 Minutes

What it means:
- If nobody uses the app for 15 minutes, the backend "goes to sleep"
- First person to load the app after that wait 30-60 seconds
- After that, app is fast again

Why this happens:
- Free tier Render limitation
- Not an error or bug

Workaround:
- Upgrade to Render paid plan ($7/month) for 24/7 uptime
- Or just accept the occasional 30-60 second wait

---

Limitation 2: Gmail 500 Emails Per Day

What it means:
- Can send maximum 500 notification emails per day
- Limit resets at midnight Pacific Time

Why this happens:
- Free Gmail account restriction

What to do if you hit the limit:
- Wait until midnight for reset
- Batch notifications (don't send multiple per customer per day)
- Upgrade to Google Workspace ($6/user/month) for 2,000/day limit

---

Limitation 3: Supabase 500MB Database Limit

What it means:
- Can store up to 500MB of data (customers, mail records, fees, etc.)
- Currently using 27MB (5.4%), so plenty of room

Why this happens:
- Free tier Supabase restriction

Timeline:
- Estimated 12-18 months before reaching limit at current growth
- Upgrade to Pro ($25/month) when you hit 400MB

---

Limitation 4: No Automatic Payment Processing

What it means:
- System calculates storage fees automatically
- But customers can't pay online through the app
- You must collect payment manually (cash, check, etc.)
- Then mark fee as "Paid" in the system

Why:
- Adding payment processing (Stripe, PayPal) would require:
  * Additional development work
  * Monthly fees
  * PCI compliance
  * Legal/tax considerations

Workaround:
- Continue manual payment collection
- Or request paid development to add payment processing

---

Limitation 5: AI Scanning Not 100% Accurate

What it means:
- Camera scanning uses AI to read mail labels
- Works well with clear, legible labels
- May struggle with:
  * Handwritten addresses
  * Damaged or torn labels
  * Poor lighting
  * Blurry photos

Why:
- AI technology limitation (even the best OCR isn't perfect)

Workaround:
- Always review AI-matched customer before submitting
- Use manual entry for unclear labels
- Take photo in good lighting

---

Limitation 6: Chinese Translation Is Optional

What it means:
- App supports Chinese language toggle (i18n)
- But translation quality may vary
- Some technical terms may appear in English

Why:
- AWS Translate is optional (disabled by default to save costs)
- Manual translations can be updated by developer

What to do:
- Use English as primary language
- Enable Chinese if needed for bilingual staff
- Contact developer to improve specific translations
