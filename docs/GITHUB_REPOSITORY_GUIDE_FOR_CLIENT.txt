GITHUB REPOSITORY GUIDE FOR MEI WAY MAIL PLUS

=============================================================================
IMPORTANT: YOUR CODE IS STORED ON GITHUB
=============================================================================

What is GitHub?
GitHub is like "Google Drive for code." It stores all the source code for your Mail Management System, tracks every change ever made, and allows developers to collaborate safely.

Your Repository (Code Storage):
https://github.com/mwmailplus-boop/mail-management-system

Owner: mwmailplus-boop (your account)
Collaborators: HYC-code520 (Ariel Chen - your developer)

=============================================================================
⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY WARNINGS
=============================================================================

WARNING #1: PROTECT YOUR API KEYS

🚨 NEVER commit API keys, passwords, or secrets to GitHub 🚨

What are API keys?
- Secret passwords that let your app talk to other services
- Examples: Supabase keys, Google API keys, Gemini AI keys

Why this matters:
If someone finds these keys on GitHub, they can:
- Use your services without permission
- Rack up charges on your account
- Access your customer data
- Potentially cost you $100 to $100,000+ in unexpected bills

✅ How to stay safe:
- API keys should ONLY be stored in:
  * Vercel Environment Variables (frontend)
  * Render Environment Variables (backend)
  * Your secure backup (password manager or encrypted drive)
  
- API keys should NEVER appear in:
  * GitHub code files
  * README files
  * Comments in code
  * Public repositories

Current Status: ✅ Your keys are safely stored in environment variables, NOT in GitHub.


---

WARNING #2: KEEP REPOSITORY PRIVATE

Your repository should be set to PRIVATE, not PUBLIC.

Why?
- Protects your business logic
- Prevents competitors from copying your features
- Keeps your code secure
- Reduces risk of someone finding vulnerabilities

✅ How to check:
1. Go to: https://github.com/mwmailplus-boop/mail-management-system
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll to bottom → "Danger Zone"
4. Look for "Change repository visibility"
5. Should say: "This repository is currently private"

If it says PUBLIC:
1. Click "Change visibility"
2. Select "Make private"
3. Type the repository name to confirm
4. Click "I understand, make this repository private"

Current Status: ✅ Your repository is currently set to PRIVATE.


---

WARNING #3: ENABLE TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (2FA)

2FA adds extra security to your GitHub account.

What is 2FA?
When you log in, GitHub asks for:
1. Your password (something you know)
2. A code from your phone (something you have)

Why this matters:
- Prevents hackers from accessing your code even if they steal your password
- Required by many businesses and insurance policies
- Industry standard for protecting valuable assets

✅ How to enable 2FA:

Step 1: Download an authenticator app on your phone
- Google Authenticator (free)
- Microsoft Authenticator (free)
- Authy (free)
- 1Password (if you use it)

Step 2: Enable 2FA on GitHub
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/security
2. Click "Enable two-factor authentication"
3. Choose "Set up using an app"
4. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app
5. Enter the 6-digit code from your phone
6. Save your backup codes in a safe place (more on this below)

Step 3: Save backup codes
- GitHub gives you 16 backup codes (like: 12345-67890)
- Print them and store in a safe place
- Or save in your password manager
- You'll need these if you lose your phone!

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Without backup codes and without your phone, you could lose access to your account permanently.

Current Status: ⚠️ 2FA needs to be enabled on your account (mwmailplus-boop).


=============================================================================
REPOSITORY ACCESS MANAGEMENT
=============================================================================

Who has access to your code?

OWNER (you):
- Username: mwmailplus-boop
- Access Level: Owner (full control)
- Can: Everything - view code, edit, delete, transfer

COLLABORATORS:
- Username: HYC-code520 (Ariel Chen)
- Access Level: Collaborator (write access)
- Can: View code, make changes, push updates
- Cannot: Delete repository, change settings, transfer ownership

---

✅ RECOMMENDED: Review access quarterly

Every 3 months, check who has access:

1. Go to: https://github.com/mwmailplus-boop/mail-management-system/settings/access
2. Review the list of collaborators
3. Remove anyone who:
   - No longer works with you
   - Doesn't need access anymore
   - You don't recognize

How to remove someone:
1. Go to Settings → Collaborators
2. Find their name
3. Click "Remove" button
4. Confirm removal

---

✅ Access Levels Explained:

If you need to add future developers, choose the right level:

READ ACCESS:
- Can view code only
- Cannot make changes
- Good for: Consultants reviewing your code

WRITE ACCESS:
- Can view and edit code
- Can push changes
- Good for: Active developers

ADMIN ACCESS:
- Full control except ownership transfer
- Can change settings
- Can add/remove team members
- Good for: Lead developer or technical manager

OWNER:
- Complete control
- Can delete or transfer repository
- Should be: You (the business owner)


=============================================================================
BRANCH PROTECTION (PREVENTING ACCIDENTAL CHANGES)
=============================================================================

What are branches?
Think of branches like "versions" of your code:
- main branch = The official, working version (what's live on your website)
- develop branch = Where new features are tested before going live
- Other branches = Individual features being worked on

Your current setup:
- Default branch: main
- Deployment branch: main (Vercel and Render both deploy from here)
- Protection: ✅ Enabled (requires pull requests, blocks direct changes)

---

Why branch protection matters:

WITHOUT protection:
- Anyone with access can accidentally break the live website
- No review process before changes go live
- Hard to undo mistakes

WITH protection (your current setup):
- Changes must go through a "Pull Request" (PR)
- Someone must review and approve changes
- Can't accidentally push broken code to production
- Easy to rollback if something goes wrong

---

✅ Your current protection rules:

On the "main" branch:
- ✅ Require pull requests before merging
- ✅ Block direct pushes (must go through PR)
- ✅ Block force pushes (can't overwrite history)
- ✅ Block branch deletion (can't accidentally delete main)

This means:
- You or your developer cannot accidentally break the live site
- All changes are reviewed and documented
- You have a clear history of what changed and when

Status: ✅ Branch protection is enabled and working correctly.


=============================================================================
REPOSITORY DOCUMENTATION
=============================================================================

Your repository includes helpful documentation files:

README.md (Main documentation file)
Location: https://github.com/mwmailplus-boop/mail-management-system/blob/main/README.md

What it contains:
- Project overview
- How to install and run locally
- Tech stack (React, Node.js, Supabase, etc.)
- Deployment instructions
- Links to other documentation

/docs folder (Detailed guides)
Location: https://github.com/mwmailplus-boop/mail-management-system/tree/main/docs

Contains 100+ technical documents:
- Setup guides
- API documentation
- OAuth2 setup
- Troubleshooting
- Feature explanations
- Database schema
- And much more!

---

✅ How to view documentation:

Method 1: On GitHub website
1. Go to your repository
2. Click on "README.md" or "/docs" folder
3. Read directly on GitHub

Method 2: Download and read offline
1. Click green "Code" button
2. Click "Download ZIP"
3. Extract and open files in any text editor

Method 3: Share with developers
- Just send them the GitHub repository link
- They can read all documentation directly


=============================================================================
GITHUB ACTIONS & AUTOMATION (IF APPLICABLE)
=============================================================================

What are GitHub Actions?
Automated tasks that run when you push code to GitHub.

Your project uses:
- Automated testing (runs tests to check code quality)
- Deployment triggers (tells Vercel/Render to deploy new code)

Secrets in GitHub Actions:
Some automations need API keys or passwords.

✅ How to check GitHub Actions secrets:

1. Go to: https://github.com/mwmailplus-boop/mail-management-system/settings/secrets/actions
2. You'll see a list of secret names (not the actual values)
3. Only repository admins can view or edit these

⚠️ Important:
- These secrets are separate from Vercel/Render environment variables
- If you change API keys, update them here too
- Never share these secrets publicly

Current Status: Check with your developer if any Actions secrets need updating.


=============================================================================
BACKUP & DISASTER RECOVERY
=============================================================================

Good news: GitHub IS your backup!

Every change ever made to your code is stored permanently in GitHub's version history.

But here's what you should know:

✅ GitHub automatically backs up:
- All code changes
- Complete version history
- All branches and tags
- Pull requests and issues

✅ You can manually backup:

Method 1: Download ZIP (quick snapshot)
1. Go to your repository
2. Click green "Code" button
3. Click "Download ZIP"
4. Save to external drive or cloud storage

Method 2: Git clone (full backup with history)
Ask your developer to:
1. Clone the repository to their computer
2. Create a backup archive
3. Store securely

Recommended backup schedule:
- Monthly: Download ZIP and store offline
- Before major changes: Create a git tag (v1.1.0, v1.2.0, etc.)
- Annually: Full clone backup to external drive

---

⚠️ What GitHub does NOT backup:
- Environment variables (Vercel/Render)
- Database content (Supabase)
- User uploads or files stored elsewhere

Make sure to backup those separately (see main handoff document).


=============================================================================
GITHUB ISSUES & PROJECT BOARD (OPTIONAL)
=============================================================================

GitHub Issues = Bug tracking and feature requests

Think of Issues like a "to-do list" for your code.

How to use:

Create an issue when:
- You find a bug ("Email notifications not sending")
- You want a new feature ("Add Spanish language support")
- You have a question for the developer

✅ How to create an issue:

1. Go to: https://github.com/mwmailplus-boop/mail-management-system/issues
2. Click green "New issue" button
3. Give it a clear title: "Bug: Customer can't reset password"
4. Describe the problem:
   - What happened?
   - What should happen?
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Screenshots (if helpful)
5. Assign to your developer (HYC-code520)
6. Click "Submit new issue"

Your developer will:
- Review the issue
- Ask clarifying questions
- Fix the problem
- Close the issue when done

---

GitHub Projects (Project Board)

Visual board to track work in progress.

Columns:
- To Do (planned features/fixes)
- In Progress (actively being worked on)
- Done (completed)

✅ How to create a project board:

1. Go to: https://github.com/mwmailplus-boop/mail-management-system/projects
2. Click "New project"
3. Choose "Board" template
4. Drag issues between columns as work progresses

Benefits:
- See what's being worked on at a glance
- Track progress on new features
- Great for planning with your developer

Current Status: Optional - set up if you plan ongoing development.


=============================================================================

COMMON QUESTIONS
=============================================================================

Q: What if I lose access to my GitHub account?

A: If you have 2FA backup codes:
   - Use one of the backup codes to log in
   - Reset your password
   - Set up 2FA again with a new device

   If you DON'T have backup codes:
   - Contact GitHub Support: support@github.com
   - Prove your identity (may take several days)
   - This is why saving backup codes is SO important!

---

Q: Can I give access to someone temporarily?

A: Yes!
   1. Add them as a collaborator with "Read" access only
   2. Set a calendar reminder to remove them after X days
   3. When done, remove their access immediately

---

Q: What if my developer pushes broken code?

A: Don't panic! You can rollback:
   1. Go to the previous working deployment in Vercel/Render
   2. Click "Rollback" or "Promote to Production"
   3. Ask your developer to fix the issue
   4. Redeploy when fixed

   This is why branch protection is important!

---

Q: Should I learn to code to manage this better?

A: Not necessary! You should:
   - Understand what GitHub does (stores your code)
   - Know how to manage access (add/remove people)
   - Know basic security practices (2FA, private repos)
   
   But you DON'T need to:
   - Learn to code
   - Understand the technical details
   - Make code changes yourself

   Leave coding to the developers, you focus on the business!

---

Q: What happens if GitHub goes down?

A: Very rare, but:
   - Your website keeps running (it's deployed to Vercel/Render)
   - You just can't push new code changes temporarily
   - GitHub has 99.99% uptime
   - Check status at: https://www.githubstatus.com

---

Q: Can I move my code to a different platform?

A: Yes! GitHub uses Git, which is an open standard.
   You can export your code and move to:
   - GitLab
   - Bitbucket
   - Self-hosted Git server
   
   But GitHub is the industry standard and has the best tools.

---

Q: How much does GitHub cost?

A: Your current usage:
   - Plan: Free
   - Cost: $0/month
   - Includes: Unlimited private repositories, unlimited collaborators
   
   You might need to upgrade if:
   - You need advanced security features ($4/month per user)
   - You need more storage for large files ($5/month per 50GB)
   
   For your use case, free plan is perfect!
