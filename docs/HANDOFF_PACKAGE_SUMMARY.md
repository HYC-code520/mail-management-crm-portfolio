## 🎨 Writing Style Highlights

**How I made it non-technical:**

✅ **Used analogies:**
- GitHub = "Google Drive for code"
- Vercel = "Company that makes website available 24/7"
- Supabase = "Very organized Excel spreadsheet"
- 2FA = "Two locks instead of one"

✅ **Explained everything:**
- What each service does
- Why it matters
- What could go wrong
- How to fix it

✅ **Used simple language:**
- No jargon without explanation
- Short sentences
- Bullet points for easy scanning
- Lots of examples

✅ **Added visual structure:**
- Checkboxes for tasks
- Tables for comparison
- Icons for quick recognition
- Clear headings and sections

✅ **Made it actionable:**
- Step-by-step instructions
- "Click here, then do this"
- Screenshots placeholders
- Time estimates

## 🔍 Finding Placeholders to Fill In

**Before giving to client, search and replace:**

```bash
# In any text editor, search for:
[YOUR          # Your information (name, email, phone)
[CLIENT        # Client information  
[DEVELOPER     # Your developer info
___            # Blank lines to fill in
https://___    # URLs to complete
$[X            # Costs to specify (like $[XX] or $[XXX])

# Example replacements:
[YOUR NAME] → John Smith
[CLIENT EMAIL] → client@business.com
[YOUR WEBSITE URL] → https://meiway-mail.vercel.app
$[XX] → $150 (if your hourly rate is $150)
_______________ → January 15, 2026 (for dates)
```
